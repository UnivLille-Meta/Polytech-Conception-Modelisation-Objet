## Exercice 02: Prof Stef interactive tutorial

Pharo includes an interactive tutorial inside the IDE called *ProfStef*.
You can open it from a playground that you can get in the menu *Browse > Playground*.
A playground is like an interactive console with vitamins.
Inside you can type any code you want and execute it by 

 - selecting the code you want
 - right click -> *Do it*

If you tried the two lines of code before, you probably noticed that a *Do it* on *1 + 1* did nothing.
That is because *1 + 1* is an expression with a value, but it does not have any observable side effect.
If you want to see the return value of an expression, you need to do *Print it* or *Do it and go* instead.
For more, the ProfStef tutorial will guide you through the syntax of the language and the main ways to interact with the playground.
